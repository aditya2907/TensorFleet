```

### 3.2 Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for user-facing operations
- **Asynchronous**: gRPC for internal service communication
- **Event-driven**: Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
- **Data Flow**: MinIO for model artifacts, MongoDB for metadata

### 3.3 Deployment Architecture
- **Containerization**: All services deployed as Docker containers
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Production Ready**: Complete Kubernetes manifests in `kubenetes/` directory for production deployment
- **Cloud Database**: MongoDB Atlas integration for managed database services
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx for frontend, internal load balancing for services

**Automated Deployment**: We provide `k8s/deploy.sh` to deploy the entire TensorFleet platform in one command. The script supports building images (`--build-images`), optional automatic loading to Minikube, and flags to skip waiting for rollouts. A companion script `k8s/build-images.sh` will build all service images and can optionally push or load them into Minikube.

**Default Local Configuration**: For convenience the Kubernetes manifests include sensible defaults for local development:
- `tensorfleet-config` ConfigMap defaults MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas cloud connection with secure credentials
- `tensorfleet-secrets` defaults MinIO credentials to `minioadmin/minioadmin` and will be created by the deploy script if missing.
- Complete Kubernetes manifests available in `kubenetes/` directory generated via Kompose conversion

These defaults are suitable for local development (Minikube) and should be overridden for production using external secret management or CI pipelines that inject production credentials.

## Appendix A: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR 1: Service Decomposition and Granularity

**Context:**  
TensorFleet needed to support scalable, maintainable, and independently deployable components for distributed ML training. The team had to decide between a monolithic architecture, coarse-grained services, or fine-grained microservices.

**Decision:**  
We adopted a microservices architecture, decomposing the system into 12+ independent services (API Gateway, Orchestrator, Worker, Monitoring, Storage, etc.), each with a single responsibility and clear boundaries.

**Consequences (Trade-offs):**  
- **Positive:**  
  - Independent scaling and deployment of services.
  - Improved fault isolation—failures in one service do not cascade.
  - Technology heterogeneity (Go for orchestration, Python for ML).
  - Easier team parallelism and codebase ownership.
- **Negative:**  
  - Increased operational complexity (service discovery, configuration, monitoring).
  - Higher resource overhead (multiple containers, inter-service communication).
  - More complex debugging and distributed tracing.

---

### ADR 2: Inter-Service Communication Pattern

**Context:**  
The platform required reliable, efficient communication between services (e.g., job submission, worker coordination, monitoring). Options included REST, gRPC, and message brokers (Kafka/RabbitMQ).

**Decision:**  
We chose REST APIs for user-facing operations (API Gateway ↔ Frontend) and gRPC for internal service-to-service communication (API Gateway ↔ Orchestrator ↔ Workers). Redis Pub/Sub is used for real-time updates and lightweight eventing.

**Consequences (Trade-offs):**  
- **Positive:**  
  - gRPC provides high performance, strong typing, and efficient binary serialization for internal comms.
  - REST is widely supported and easy to consume for external clients.
  - Redis Pub/Sub enables low-latency event notifications.
- **Negative:**  
  - gRPC requires additional tooling (protobufs, codegen) and is less human-readable than REST.
  - Multiple protocols increase maintenance and learning curve.
  - Redis Pub/Sub is not persistent—missed events if consumers are offline.

---

### ADR 3: Deployment and Orchestration Strategy

**Context:**  
TensorFleet needed a deployment approach that supports local development, easy scaling, and production readiness. Options included bare-metal deployment, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

**Decision:**  
We containerized all services using Docker and used Docker Compose for local development. For production, the system is designed to be Kubernetes-ready, with manifests provided for scalable, resilient deployment.

**Consequences (Trade-offs):**  
- **Positive:**  
  - Consistent environments across dev, test, and prod.
  - Easy local setup with Docker Compose.
  - Kubernetes enables auto-scaling, self-healing, and advanced orchestration.
- **Negative:**  
  - Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and operational overhead.
  - More complex CI/CD and configuration management.
  - Resource usage is higher compared to bare-metal or single-container setups.

---

### ADR 4: Database Migration to MongoDB Atlas

**Context:**  
Initially, TensorFleet used a local MongoDB instance deployed alongside other services. As the project matured, concerns arose about database reliability, backup management, scalability, and operational overhead for production deployments.

**Decision:**  
We migrated from a self-hosted MongoDB container to MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database service. All services were updated to connect to MongoDB Atlas using secure connection strings with authentication credentials.

**Consequences (Trade-offs):**  
- **Positive:**  
  - Automated backups and point-in-time recovery.
  - Built-in high availability with replica sets and automatic failover.
  - Reduced operational complexity—no need to manage MongoDB upgrades, patches, or scaling.
  - Better performance monitoring and optimization tools provided by Atlas.
  - Simplified local development—no need to run MongoDB container locally.
  - Geographic distribution options for reduced latency.
- **Negative:**  
  - Ongoing cloud service costs (though offset by reduced operational overhead).
  - External dependency on MongoDB Atlas service availability.
  - Network latency for database operations (mitigated by choosing appropriate regions).
  - Requires internet connectivity for database access during development.
  - Credentials management becomes more critical for security.
